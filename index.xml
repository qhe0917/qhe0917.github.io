      <description>Yesterday, I was doing the job hunting on Indeed. But, there are so many job openings with so many information. Then I realized that, I can extract some information from these job descriptions, including the frequently mentioned keywords, word paires and word clouds for each searching key words. Later, I can write my resume that emphasizes my skills match the frequently mentioned keywords, it will be easier for me to modify my resume based on different job descriptions.</description>
